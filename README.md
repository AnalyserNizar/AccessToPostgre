This Git branch (`complete-rewrite`) represents a complete rewrite of the Database Cloner application. The previous version has been redesigned and refactored to improve code organization, maintainability, and introduce object-oriented principles.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Approach**: The application has been restructured using object-oriented principles, making the code more modular and extensible.

- **Design Patterns**: The new version (will!) incorporate the Factory Method pattern, which provides a flexible way to create database connections based on the database type.

## Getting Started

To run the Database Cloner application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Switch to the `complete-rewrite` branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout complete-rewrite
